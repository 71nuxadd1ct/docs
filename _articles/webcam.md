If you can’t see the image from your webcam or you receive a "No device found!" error when you try to use it: close all applications that can use the webcam, press <kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd> to turn the camera on, and then open a webcam application like <u>Cheese</u> that is pre-installed on your System76 machine. You will now see the image from the webcam in the app.
