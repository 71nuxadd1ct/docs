The **Terminal** is a tool for issuing text-based commands to your Ubuntu Operating System. When you type a command, you are basically telling your computer to do something very specific. The quickest way to install, remove or update applications is through the Terminal. A Terminal is sometimes referred to as the Shell, Command Line, or Command Prompt.
To open a terminal, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>

You can also tap your **Ubuntu key** to search your computer and type the word 'Terminal.'

A box like the one below will appear.
