Congratulations on receiving your System76 Desktop! Read this article to get started quickly.

### Bag of Cables
If you ordered a desktop without the max amount of drives, you'll receive an extra bag of parts. This can include hard drive cables, screws or antennas. Remove the black antennas from your bag of extras, and set the rest of the parts aside. You will use the cables and screws if you decide to add other components at a later date.

### Wireless Antennas
To enable WiFi capability, screw the black antennas to the back of the desktop where the wireless card is located, as shown below.

### Connect Your Monitor
If you ordered a graphics card, you will plug your monitor into one of the horizontal ports on the back of the machine. Do not connect your display to the vertical ports if you have a graphics card. The vertical ports are directly connected to the motherboard and are disabled if there is a dedicated graphics card. Please see below to determine where to plug your monitor into.

### Connect Keyboard and Mouse
Keyboards can connect via USB ports, PS/2 circular port, or wirelessly. If your keyboard/mouse connect wirelessly, you should have a small USB device, called a receiver, that connects to the desktop and communicates with your keyboard and mouse via radio frequency. This should be included when you purchase a wireless keyboard or mouse. You can connect to the front USB ports or the back, depending on where your cords will extend/fit.

### Connect Power Supply
The power supply is located on the bottom of the back of the desktop. Use the cord provided to connect the computer to the nearest outlet.

### Power On
Press the circular button on the front of the machine after all components are plugged in. The power button is the largest button on the front of the machine.

### Set Up User Account
When you power on, you'll be prompted to create a user account, which is the administrative account. The password you set for this account will be the main password for when you install applications or updates, or add new users to the computer. 

### Frequently Asked Questions
