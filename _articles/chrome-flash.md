If you want to play Flash games or videos, or watch movies on Netflix in Ubuntu, you'll need to download the Chrome Web Browser. Chrome is available free-of-charge from Google and includes support for Flash playback and many popular video streaming services.

#### <small>Since Ubuntu 14.04, it's is no longer recommended to use Firefox for Flash content online due to security concerns. </small>

## 1. Download Chrome

First, you'll need to [download Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Click the blue "Download Now" button:

You can click on Chrome here to run it. For easy access, you can drag the item to the Launcher on the left:
