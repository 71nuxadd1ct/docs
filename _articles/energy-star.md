As a “new” ENERGY STAR ® partner, System76, Inc is dedicated to an ongoing commitment to energy efficiency. Any System76 product bearing the ENERGY STAR® emblem electronically or physically on the product is certified to comply with the EPA ENERGY STAR requirements as configured when shipped by System76.

ENERGY STAR power-management features save energy by allowing computers to enter a very low power (suspend) mode when not in use for a specified period of time. These power-management features are activated on all ENERGY STAR qualified computers including subcategories listed below.

The power-management features are preset to allow the computer and monitor to power down (suspend) after the following periods of inactivity when plugged into AC mains:

Product Type       | Operating System  | Laptop        
:------------------|:-----------------:|---------------:
Galago Pro - 14"   | Ubuntu            | 30 Minutes

[Add instruction for changing the automatic suspend setting here with screenshots.]

The laptop can be woken from the suspend state by pressing the power button.

Wake on LAN (WOL)
Computers configured with WOL can also be woken from the sleep state by a network signal. WOL works only when the computer is connected to an AC power supply and may differ based on hardware. The speed of any active 1 Gb/s Ethernet network link is reduced when transitioning to sleep.

Wake Management
Computers with Ethernet capability that are shipped through enterprise channels (sales channels typically used by large and medium-sized business, government, educational, or other organizations to purchase computers for use in managed client or server environments) are capable of both remote (via network) and scheduled (via real-time clock) wake events from sleep state. For additional power-management specific information, see [Energy Star](www.energystar.gov/powermanagement).
