If you want to view content developed using Adobe Flash or streaming sites like Netflix in Ubuntu, you will need to download the Chrome Web Browser. Chrome is available free-of-charge from Google and includes support for Flash playback and Video Streaming services built-in.

Since Ubuntu 14.04, it's is no longer recommended to use Firefox for Flash content on internet sites due to scurity concerns.
