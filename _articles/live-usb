Ubuntu is remakably flexible -- enough so that you can run a full version of Ubuntu from a USB drive (often known as a thumb drive, flash drive, or USB stick) or a DVD in what's known as a *live environment.* Using a live environment (live disk) is useful for:

* [Determining if an issue is caused by hardware or software](http://support.system76.com/articles/hardware-failure/)
* [Reinstalling](support.system76.com/articles/restore/) or [upgrading](http://support.system76.com/articles/upgrade/) your Ubuntu installation
* [Fixing the boot loader](support.system76.com/articles/grub/)
* Recovering your normal environment
* Backing up files when you can't boot

You can understand why a live disk is a handy tool to have around! Note that it's typically called a *live disk* since you can use either a USB or DVD. USB is recommended, since it's significantly faster.

## How do I create a live disk?

The basic steps to create a live disk are:

1. [Download](https://www.ubuntu.com/download) an ISO copy of Ubuntu
2. Connect a USB or DVD drive
3. Use a special program (Startup Disk Creator, Rufus, unetbootin, or dd) to write the ISO to disk

If you're upgrading or reinstalling Ubuntu, choose the version you plan on installing. If you're using the live disk for recovery purposes, try and match the same version.

Ubuntu has provided step-by-step guides to create install media:

### Using **dd** to create a live USB

If you have a Linux (or macOS) system available, you can create a live USB using a command line tool called `dd``. **Please note, this is an advanced method. `dd` is a simple and powerful tool which can overwrite any drive, destination, or file. Use with caution!**

Warnings aside, `dd` is safe and highly effective when used properly. Be sure to confirm your destination file `of=` before running the command.

1. Insert the USB drive
2. Run `lsblk` to get a listing of all block-level devices and their mountpoints (`mount` is also useful`)
3. Unmount the USB with `umount /dev/[path-to-usb-drive]`
4. Write out your `dd` command. **The following assumes the ISO is in the ~/Downloads folder and is being writing to /dev/sdf -- substitute the correct paths for your system!**

```
sudo dd if=~/Downloads/ubuntu-17.04-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdf
```
5. **Confirm the output file path is correct** -- open a new terminal if needed!
6. If everything looks good, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to write the ISO to disk.

Since `dd` is writing to a device at the block level, it requires elevated permissions via `sudo`. You will be prompted for your password.

7. The ISO is a large file, and it takes several minutes to write. The system might not look like it's doing anything. Be patient!
8. Once complete, `dd` will print a final count of blocks in/out.

## Booting from a live disk

After creating the live disk, insert the USB or DVD into your computer, then reboot or power on your system. You'll need to tell the computer to boot from the live disk by holding a key:

Laptops                             | Desktops
----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------
Hold <kbd>F7</kbd> or <kbd>F1</kbd> | Hold <kbd>F12</kbd>, <kbd>F8</kbd>, or <kbd>F10</kbd>
