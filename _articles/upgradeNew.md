# Upgrading to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS is the latest release of Ubuntu. It brings usability improvements and faster system performance resulting in a more responsive desktop experience. Major open source applications are also updated including LibreOffice, Firefox, Thunderbird, and more.

## 1. Prepare for the Upgrade

First, we recommend having Ubuntu installation media (i.e. a DVD or USB drive) handy before starting any upgrades in case something goes wrong. You'll need to download a copy of Ubuntu. You can download a copy from [ubuntu.com](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Save the file on your hard drive.

Next, we recommend backing up all important files from your comptuer. The upgrade process will leave your files intact, but it's best to be safe in case something goes wrong.

## 2. Upgrade

When you're ready, follow the [official Ubuntu upgrade process](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/upgrade). The System76 driver repository will be disabled during the upgrade process, but we will re-enable it in the next step.

You will want to be present throughout the upgrade process as there may be prompts requiring your input.

If asked about installation of `grub_pc` during the upgrade, you should select to **_Install the Package Maintainer's version_**, not the default option.

## 3. Install the System76 Driver

Once you've upgraded Ubuntu, you'll need to download and install the System76 Driver. Open the Terminal app (search _Terminal_ from the Ubuntu dash or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), then enter the following commands:

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:system76-dev/stable
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install system76-driver

---

**For NVIDIA Graphics:** If you ordered a system with a discreet Nvidia graphics card, you will need to manually install the drivers for your card to get the optimum performance. Open the Terminal app and enter the following command:

    sudo apt install system76-driver-nvidia

---

Once the process is finished, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
