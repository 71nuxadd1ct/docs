Click the 'Install' button (we have it installed already on this system)


## Install Steam from the Command Line Interface (CLI)

If you can also install Steam from the _Terminal_ application. To launch the _Terminal_ application you can use the *Dash* to search for it if it is not pinned on your *Launcher*.

Once the _Terminal_ application is opened you can use the Command Line tool *apt* to search for it like so:

Once we find the right name for Steam we can install it with *apt* as well.

***Be very careful when using sudo with *ANY* Command. It can make system wide changes so be sure to read everything before entering 'Y'.***
