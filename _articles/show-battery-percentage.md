To show the battery percentage in the top bar in Pop!\_OS, you will need to install a GNOME extension.

### Installing GNOME Extensions
To get started with installing GNOME extensions, install the GNOME Tweak Tool and Chrome GNOME Shell using the following commands:
```shell
sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool chrome-gnome-shell
```

Then open Firefox or Chromium (or Google Chrome) and install the GNOME shell integration tool if needed:
- [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gnome-shell-integration/)
- [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gnome-shell-integration/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep?hl=en)

Once the shell integration software is done, you can move on to installing the battery percentage extension.

### Installing the Battery Percentage Extension
Navigate to the [battery extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/818/battery-percentage/). Click the slider on the right which says "OFF".
